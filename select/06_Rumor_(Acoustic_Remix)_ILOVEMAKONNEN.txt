Don't let 'em start the rumor, don't let 'em start the
Don't let them start the rumor, don't let them start the rumor
Don't let them start the rumor, don't them start the
Don't let them start the rumor
I heard you out here selling dope and turned your back on your family
Now you wanna live a new life and moving out to Germany
You probably broke and never left the state and you never wanna miss with faith
They say you get another new ride but it's stolen from outta' state
I tell 'em
Don't let 'em start the rumor, don't let 'em start the
Don't let them start the rumor, don't let them start the rumor
Don't let them start the rumor, don't them start the
Don't let them start the rumor
I'll be moving from the Brooklyn soon
I'm riding sober out here with no crew
They never wanna' choose me, but I always wanna choose you
I swear that I should leave the game alone
And go back to my happy home
I can move it out to Texas and trappin' with my Mexicans
I tell 'em
Don't let 'em start the rumor, don't let 'em start the
Don't let them start the rumor, don't let them start the rumor
Don't let them start the rumor, don't them start the
Don't let them start the rumor
