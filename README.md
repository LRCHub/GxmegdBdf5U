[00:02.23] Girl you know I've known you forever
[00:21.64] How many nights we hung out together
[00:25.49] Same little crowd, little bar, little town
[00:28.55] Round this old dance floor
[00:30.89] My boys are laughin' and tap me on the shoulder
[00:35.65] Makin' a motion like "Could y'all get any closer?"
[00:39.20] They wanna know what's up when I'm still holdin' ya
[00:42.68] Even when the song is over
[00:55.68] 
[00:45.19] There's a rumor goin' round about me and you
[00:50.49] Stirrin' up our little town the last week or two
[00:57.51] So tell me why we even tryin' to deny this feelin'
[01:02.73] I feel, don't you feel it too?
[01:05.28] There's a rumor goin' round, and round, and round
[01:09.47] What d'you say we make it true?
[01:11.77] We make it true
[01:19.27] 
[01:13.82] Well I can shut 'em down, tell 'em all they're crazy
[01:23.65] I can do whatever you want me to do, baby
[01:27.12] Or you could lay one on me right now
[01:30.18] We could really give them som'in' to talk about
[01:53.68] 
[01:32.61] There's a rumor goin' round 'bout me and you
[01:38.36] Stirrin' up our little town the last week or two
[01:45.08] So tell me why we even tryin' to deny this feelin'
[01:50.24] I feel, don't you feel it too?
[01:52.40] There's a rumor goin' round, and round, and round
[01:57.16] What d'you say we make it true, baby?
[02:15.66] 
[02:02.77] Oh be honest girl now
[02:16.51] Do you want to do this or not?
[02:19.59] Should we keep them talkin', girl
[02:24.17] Or should we just make 'em stop?
[02:40.17] 
[02:26.89] There's a rumor goin' round 'bout me and you
[02:32.61] Stirrin' up our little town (the last week) the last week or two
[02:40.60] So tell me why we even tryin' to deny this feelin'
[02:45.02] I feel, and you feel it too?
[02:46.89] There's a rumor goin' round, and round, and round
[02:51.46] What d'you say we make it-
[03:04.46] 
[02:53.52] Make it true?
[02:57.74] What d'you say we make it true?
